RVCI (Rust Volume Control Interface) is a hardware-software project which can control individual app volumes in W10/11 using basic hardware


This project is currently work in progress. Current repo files might or might not work properly. This version includes a fully working GUI, volume control functionality as well as audio output switcher.
RVCI was heavily inspired by Deej, however, Deej is no longer maintained and recent Windows updates heavily broke its functionality. I decided to write a new and improved version of it in Rust, and am adding the functionality I wish Deej had.
Also, I hated writing in Go.
